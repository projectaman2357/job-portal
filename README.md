Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following software installed:

Node.js (version X.X.X or above)

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is required to run both the frontend and backend of this project.
Git

Git is used to clone the project repository to your local machine.
MongoDB

MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store and manage data in this project.
React

React is already included as a dependency in the frontend, so you only need to install it when setting up the frontend.
Frontend Setup
To run the frontend of this project:

1. Clone the repository:
If you haven't already cloned the repository, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
2. Navigate to the client directory:
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the client folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd repository-name/client
3. Install dependencies:
To install the required dependencies for the frontend, run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will download all the necessary packages specified in the client/package.json file.

4. Start the frontend server:
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the React development server by running the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000 in your browser. Any changes you make in the frontend code will automatically reload the page.

Backend Setup
To run the backend of this project:

1. Navigate to the server directory:
After cloning the repository, go to the server folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd repository-name/server
2. Install backend dependencies:
Install the required backend dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
This will install all the necessary packages specified in the server/package.json file.

3. Set up MongoDB:
Before running the server, you need a MongoDB database to store your data.

Option 1: Local MongoDB Setup
If you're using MongoDB locally on your machine:

Ensure that MongoDB is installed on your machine. If not, follow the MongoDB installation guide.

Start the MongoDB server:

On Windows/macOS, you can start MongoDB by running the following command in a terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
mongod
On Linux, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo service mongod start
Your MongoDB server will now be running locally, typically at mongodb://localhost:27017. This is the default URI for connecting to the database.

Option 2: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud Setup)
If you're using MongoDB Atlas (cloud version), you'll need to:

Sign up for MongoDB Atlas.
Create a cluster and get the connection URI.
Replace the default connection URI in the .env file of the server folder with your Atlas connection URI.
Example MongoDB URI in .env:

env
Copy
Edit
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
If you're using MongoDB Atlas, the URI might look like:

env
Copy
Edit
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/mydb
4. Set up environment variables:
In the server directory, create a .env file and add the necessary environment variables:

env
Copy
Edit
PORT=5000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Ensure that DB_URI points to the correct MongoDB instance.

5. Start the backend server:
Once the environment variables are set, you can start the backend server with:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

Run Both Frontend and Backend
1. Frontend and Backend in Separate Terminals:
You can run the frontend and backend in separate terminal windows:

Open one terminal for the frontend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd repository-name/client
npm start
Open another terminal for the backend:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd repository-name/server
npm start
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000, and the backend will be available at http://localhost:5000.

2. Using concurrently to Run Both:
Alternatively, you can use the concurrently package to run both servers in one terminal:

Install concurrently as a dev dependency in the root directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install concurrently --save-dev
Modify the package.json in the root directory to include a start script that runs both the frontend and backend:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "start": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\"",
  "client": "npm start --prefix client",
  "server": "npm start --prefix server"
}
Now, run both the frontend and backend with:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
MongoDB Setup
MongoDB is used as the database for this project. You can set up MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

Local MongoDB Setup:
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

Start the MongoDB server with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
mongod
MongoDB Atlas Setup:
Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cloud database.
Replace the local MongoDB URI in the .env file with your MongoDB Atlas connection string.
Example of MongoDB URI:

env
Copy
Edit
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb  # Local setup
# OR
DB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/mydb  # Atlas setup
Troubleshooting
1. "Module not found" errors:
Ensure all dependencies are installed by running npm install in both the client and server directories.
2. CORS Issues:
If you're getting CORS errors when making API requests from the frontend to the backend, make sure to use a CORS middleware in your backend.
In the server folder, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install cors
And in server/index.js, add:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
